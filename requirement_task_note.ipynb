    "**1. Analysis of Topic 19: Insurance Management System Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of what you need to build for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Goal:** Develop a system using MySQL and Python to manage insurance customers, policies/contracts, insurance types, claim assessments, and payouts, focusing on contract tracking, claims processing, and financial reporting.\n",
    "*   **Core Components:**\n",
    "    *   **Database:**\n",
    "        *   **Design:** Create an ER Diagram showing relationships between Customers, InsuranceContracts, InsuranceTypes, Assessments, and Payouts. Convert this ERD into a relational schema with Primary Keys (PKs), Foreign Keys (FKs), and constraints.\n",
    "        *   **Implementation:** Create the specified tables (or similar based on your final design) in MySQL.\n",
    "        *   **Data:** Populate tables with 5-10 sample records each.\n",
    "        *   **Visualization:** Include the ER diagram (e.g., from MySQL Workbench) in your deliverables.\n",
    "    *   **Functionality (To be implemented in Python):**\n",
    "        *   Manage Customer profiles.\n",
    "        *   Manage Contracts (Create, Update, Track Status).\n",
    "        *   Manage Insurance Types (Catalog, assign to contracts).\n",
    "        *   Manage Damage Assessments and track claims.\n",
    "        *   Manage Claim Payouts.\n",
    "        *   Generate Reports (on contracts, claims, total payouts).\n",
    "    *   **Advanced Database Features:**\n",
    "        *   **Indexes:** Optimize lookups for contracts and claims.\n",
    "        *   **Views:** Create views for specific data subsets (e.g., active contracts, pending claims, payout summaries).\n",
    "        *   **Stored Procedures:** Automate processes like contract generation or payout calculation.\n",
    "        *   **User Defined Functions (UDFs):** Calculate specific values like claim success rate or contract expiration dates.\n",
    "        *   **Triggers:** Automate updates based on events (e.g., update claim/payout status based on assessment results).\n",
    "    *   **Database Security & Admin:**\n",
    "        *   *Implement* user roles (e.g., insurance agents, claim assessors, admins) with appropriate permissions in MySQL.\n",
    "        *   *Address* protection of sensitive data (mention encryption, access control).\n",
    "        *   *Set up* (or describe plans for) regular backups and recovery protocols.\n",
    "        *   *Apply* (or discuss) performance tuning for contract/claim queries.\n",
    "    *   **Python Application:**\n",
    "        *   Connect Python to MySQL (`mysql-connector-python` or `SQLAlchemy`).\n",
    "        *   Develop Python \"Functional Modules\" for customer enrollment, contract management, claim entry, payout processing.\n",
    "        *   Generate reports (total payouts, active contracts, claims by type).\n",
    "        *   Create an interactive interface (CLI or optional GUI) for users (e.g., insurance agents).\n",
    "*   **Deliverables (Project Specific):** Full report (20-30 pages), SQL scripts, ER diagrams, Python code, **screenshots of system operation**, and **demo test cases** (e.g., for contract creation, claim assessment, payout calculation).\n",

    "*   **Security Requirements:** The explicit mention of user roles and data protection (encryption) requires more attention than in the library project. Implement basic roles; discuss encryption/advanced security in the report.\n",
    "*   **Test Cases:** These are a specific deliverable. Plan how you will demonstrate core functionalities (contract creation, claim assessment, payout) and document these tests.\n",
    "*   **Screenshots:** Remember to take screenshots of your application in action as you develop/test, demonstrating the key functionalities.\n",

    "# Recent Updates: UI Component Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the latest update, we've made the following modifications to the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table Display Component Change\n",
    "\n",
    "We've reverted from using AgGrid back to standard Pandas DataFrames for displaying table data. This change was made for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity** - The standard DataFrames are simpler to implement and maintain\n",
    "2. **Compatibility** - Ensures better compatibility across different environments and Streamlit versions\n",
    "3. **Reduced Dependencies** - Eliminates the need for an additional external library\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- All table displays now use `st.dataframe()` instead of AgGrid\n",
    "- No third-party AgGrid library is required for the application to run\n",
    "- Some interactive features like advanced filtering and sorting are reduced, but basic table functionality is maintained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affected Files\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main.py` - Removed AgGrid import\n",
    "- All module files in the `models` directory - Replaced AgGrid implementation with standard Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing this change, please verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All tables display correctly in all sections\n",
    "2. Performance remains acceptable with larger datasets\n",
    "3. Basic functionality like scrolling and resizing works as expected"

    "\n",
    "1. **Page Naming Convention**: Pages are prefixed with numbers to control their order in the sidebar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Caching**: Database queries use `@st.cache_data` to improve performance:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @st.cache_data(ttl=300)  # Cache data for 5 minutes\n",

    "       return data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database Connection Management**: All database connections are properly closed after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Database errors are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consistent UI**: All pages follow a consistent UI pattern with similar layouts and component usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit automatically creates a sidebar with links to each page based on the files in the `pages` directory. The order is determined by the numeric prefixes in the filenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Caching**: Database queries are cached for 5 minutes to reduce database load\n",
    "2. **Connection Pooling**: Database connections are created when needed and closed properly\n",
    "3. **Clear Cache on Updates**: Cache is cleared automatically after write operations"

    "Files in the `models` directory are responsible for:\n",
    "- Containing all SQL queries\n",

    "## 3. Benefits of This Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: UI code and business logic are kept separate\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Database queries can be reused across different pages\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify SQL queries without affecting the UI\n",
    "- **Testing**: Simpler to test business logic without UI dependencies\n",

    "\n",
    "**In pages/1_Dashboard.py (UI Layer):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary model functions\n",
    "from models.dashboard import get_dashboard_metrics, get_recent_contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get data from model layer\n",
    "metrics = get_dashboard_metrics()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display in UI\n",
    "st.metric(\"Total Customers\", metrics['customer_count'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In models/dashboard.py (Business Logic Layer):**\n",

    "    \"\"\"Get key metrics for the dashboard\"\"\"\n",
    "    # SQL queries and data processing\n",
    "    customer_count = get_cached_data(\"SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM Customers\")\n",
    "    # More logic...\n",
    "    return metrics\n",
